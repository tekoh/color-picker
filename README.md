#### status: usable

### 💡 ideas

 - [nypsi](https://github.com/tekoh/nypsi) $color command will have a link pointing to the same color on this website ✅
 - random colour on every refresh ✅
 - hex color code is easily copiable with a button / always in url bar ✅
 - history page to show previous colors (saves via cookie 🍪) ✅
 - make a favourites page \- works same as history ✅
 - make color palette system \- share favourite colors as url ✅ kinda
 - make $palette command on nypsi \- creates a color palette from role colors (patreon only) ✅
